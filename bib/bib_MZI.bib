    abstract = {The use of infrared lasers to power optical-scale lithographically fabricated particle accelerators is a developing area of research that has garnered increasing interest in recent years. The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed, which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV/m regime. The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers. Combined with the very high (MHz) repetition rates these lasers can provide, the DLA approach appears promising for a variety of applications, including future high-energy physics colliders, compact light sources, and portable medical scanners and radiative therapy machines.},

    abstract = {The enormous size and cost of current state-of-the-art accelerators based on conventional radio-frequency technology has spawned great interest in the development of new acceleration concepts that are more compact and economical. Micro-fabricated dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are an attractive approach, because such dielectric microstructures can support accelerating fields one to two orders of magnitude higher than can radio-frequency cavity-based accelerators. DLAs use commercial lasers as a power source, which are smaller and less expensive than the radio-frequency klystrons that power today’s accelerators. In addition, DLAs are fabricated via low-cost, lithographic techniques that can be used for mass production. However, despite several DLA structures having been proposed recently1,2,3,4, no successful demonstration of acceleration in these structures has so far been shown. Here we report high-gradient (beyond 250 MeV m−1) acceleration of electrons in a DLA. Relativistic (60-MeV) electrons are energy-modulated over 563 ± 104 optical periods of a fused silica grating structure, powered by a 800-nm-wavelength mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. The observed results are in agreement with analytical models and electrodynamic simulations. By comparison, conventional modern linear accelerators operate at gradients of 10–30 MeV m−1, and the first linear radio-frequency cavity accelerator was ten radio-frequency periods (one metre) long with a gradient of approximately 1.6 MeV m−1 (ref. 5). Our results set the stage for the development of future multi-staged DLA devices composed of integrated on-chip systems. This would enable compact table-top accelerators on the MeV–GeV (106–109 eV) scale for security scanners and medical therapy, university-scale X-ray light sources for biological and materials research, and portable medical imaging devices, and would substantially reduce the size and cost of a future collider on the multi-TeV (1012 eV) scale.},

    abstract = {Laser powered dielectric structures achieve high-gradient particle acceleration by taking advantage of modern laser technology capable of producing electric fields in excess of 10GV/m. These fields can drive the bulk dielectric beyond its linear response, and break the phase synchronicity between the accelerating field and the electrons. We show how control of the pulse dispersion can be used to compensate the effect of self-phase modulation and maximize the energy gain in the laser accelerator.In our experiment, a high brightness 8MeV e-beam is used to probe accelerating fields of 1.8GV/m in a 'grating-reset' dielectric structure illuminated by a 45fs laser pulse with a fluence of 0.7J/cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$.},

The adjoint approach calculates shape derivatives at all points in space, but requires only two “forward” simulations. Geometrical shape parameterization is by the level set method. Our adjoint design optimization is applied to a Silicon photonics Y-junction splitter that had previously been investigated by stochastic methods. Owing to the speed of calculating shape derivatives within the adjoint method, convergence is much faster, within a larger design space. This is an extremely efficient method for the design of complex electromagnetic components.},

Each module contains 10 independent phase-controlled Mach-Zehnder interferometers; several such modules can be connected to each other to build large reconfigurable interferometers. With this architecture, large interferometers are easier to build and characterize than with traditional, bespoke, monolithic designs. We demonstrate our approach by fabricating three modules in the form of UV-written silica-on-silicon chips. We characterize these chips, connect them to each other, and implement a wide range of linear optical transformations. We envisage that this architecture will enable many future experiments in quantum optics.},

    abstract = {Modern micro- and nanofabrication allows very complex optical systems to be fabricated, with potential applications in classical and quantum communications, sensing and information processing. We now know such systems could perform operations well beyond the classical optics of lenses and mirrors; indeed, any legal linear optical operation can be constructed from a mesh of two-beam interferometers [1,2]. One recently demonstrated example [3] is separating arbitrary overlapping orthogonal beams, without fundamental loss. Surprisingly, not only is there a simple way of designing such meshes, but the mesh can even design itself, without any calculations, opening up a new field of self-configuring, self-correcting, and self-stabilizing optics [1-3], and these meshes are well-suited to silicon photonics and possibly nanophotonic implementations. Potential applications include mode multiplexing/demultiplexing in telecommunications, microwave photonics, self-aligning beam couplers, automatic tracking of targets, automatically finding the best channels through a scattering optical system, networks for quantum applications, and many others. This different way of looking at optics has also led to a surprising fundamental advance in rewriting and extending Kirchhoff’s law of thermal radiation [4]. [1] D. A. B.

A 61.6 µm long phase shifter was fabricated in a CMOS process with oxide cladding and two metal layers. The device features a phase-shifting efﬁciency of 24.77 ± 0.43 mW/π and a -3 dB modulation bandwidth of 130.0 ± 5.59 kHz; the insertion loss measured for 21 devices across an 8-inch wafer was only 0.23 ± 0.13 dB.

However, the electron energy gain is limited by the short interaction length between the laser pulses and the electron bunch for previously reported DLAs. This paper numerically investigates the dual-grating DLAs driven by a pulse-front-tilted (PFT) laser which extends the interaction length and boosts the electrons energy gain. The optical system to generate the PFT laser beam is also studied in detail. By two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations we show that such a PFT laser effectively increases the energy gain by more than 100\% as compared to that of a normally incident laser beam.},

    abstract = {This paper describes design and simulations of dielectric laser electron accelerators that achieve Gigavolt-per-meter (GV/m) accelerating gradients and wide electron channels ({\textgreater}1 μm). The accelerator design is based on a silicon buried grating structure that enables flexible phase synchronization, large electron channel fields, and low standing-wave ratio in the material. This design increases the accelerating gradients to more than double those of reported quartz grating accelerators, thereby reducing the input laser fluence by 60\% for the same accelerating gradient. With a 100 fs pulsed laser, our silicon buried gratings can achieve a maximum gradient of 1.1 GV/m, indicating that these accelerators have potential for numerous electron-accelerator applications.},

    abstract = {Electromagnetic imaging is modelled as an inverse problem for the 3D system of Maxwell’s equations of which the isotropic conductivity distribution in the domain of interest has to be reconstructed. The main application we have in mind is the monitoring of conducting contaminant plumes out of surface and borehole electromagnetic imaging data. The essential feature of the method developed here is the use of adjoint ﬁelds for the reconstruction task, combined with a splitting of the data into smaller groups which deﬁne subproblems of the inversion problem. The method works iteratively, and can be considered as a nonlinear generalization of the algebraic reconstruction technique in x-ray tomography. Starting out from some initial guess for the conductivity distribution, an update for this guess is computed by solving one forward and one adjoint problem of the 3D Maxwell system at a time. Numerical experiments are performed for a layered background medium in which one or two localized (3D) inclusions are immersed. These have to be monitored out of surface to borehole and cross-borehole electromagnetic data. We show that the algorithm is able to recover a single inclusion in the earth which has high contrast to the background, and to distinguish between two separated inclusions in the earth given certain borehole geometries.},

    abstract = {In this paper, back propagation is reinvestigated for an efficient evaluation of the gradient in arbitrary interconnections of recurrent subsystems. It is shown that the error has to be back-propagated through the adjoint model of the system and that the gradient can only be obtained after a delay. A faster version, accelerated back propagation, that eliminates this delay, is also developed. Various schemes including the sensitivity method are studied to update the weights of the network using these gradients. Motivated by the Lyapunov approach and the adjoint model, the predictive back propagation and its variant, targeted back propagation, are proposed. A further refinement, predictive back propagation with filtering is then developed, where the states of the model are also updated. The convergence of this scheme is assured. It is shown that it is sufficient to back propagate as many time steps as the order of the system for convergence. As a preamble, convergence of on-line batch and sample-wise updates in feedforward models is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach.},

The incoming light from the fiber is split immediately over 16 channels, and therefore, the total optical power is never confined in a single waveguide. This is of particular interest for silicon photonics platforms, because, here, high optical intensities can cause significant non-linear losses. The device has a total coupling efficiency that is similar to standard focusing grating couplers. Furthermore, a channel non-uniformity below 1.1 dB has been obtained. By studying the alignment sensitivity, we found that for high splitting uniformity, a careful positioning of the fiber is necessary. We also experimentally demonstrate that this device is indeed capable of handling high optical powers without introducing additional non-linear losses.},
